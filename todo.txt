Hello Redis Tasks TODO
======================

* Limit the add() simulation time
- Monitor the worker script and show an error on the processing page when it's down (similar to when the site can't connect to Redis)
- Add multiple threads to worker so more than one task can be done at once
- Add progress reporting by using something other than sleep
